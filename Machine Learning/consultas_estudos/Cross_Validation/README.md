# Cross-validation-python

## Generalized Codes for Future Projects

Throughout this project, I've worked on developing generalized codes that can be easily applied to future projects. These codes have been crafted with versatility in mind, meaning they can seamlessly adapt to different datasets, provided they've been preprocessed effectively.

## Learning and Growth

This journey has been an enriching learning experience for me. Starting from the groundwork in Excel and transitioning to Python, I've meticulously ensured that the values generated align perfectly with those in Excel. Surprisingly, creating these codes took no more time than building a new Excel sheet. The best part? They're now primed and ready to empower future projects just as effectively.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes all Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, and evaluation, including cross-validation.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading it!

## Usage

Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them to your own churn analysis projects. Each script is well-documented and includes comments to guide you through the code.
