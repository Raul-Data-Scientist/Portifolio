# Porfolio Churn with Python

UPDATE: Actually, all this was for knowledge, because actually it wasn't in the same directory. Pay attention next time! :)

In my experience, I already have a pre-coding setup to streamline my analyses. So, I create a folder and put all the files inside it. However, when I attempted to read the file 'churn_data.csv' using Pandas to load it into a dataframe, the `read_csv` function returned an error stating that the file wasn't in the same directory, even though it was.

To resolve this issue, I sought help from chatbots to find a solution. I discovered that the problem was due to the original file being created in another directory. To confirm this, I used the following code:

```python
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```

This code confirmed that the directory was indeed different. To address this, I changed the working directory using:

```python
import os
os.chdir(path)
#Docstring: Change the current working directory to the specified path.
```

This command changes the current working directory to the specified path. With this issue resolved, I was able to proceed with my analysis. Now, let's get started for real.
